# Cleanup cadence

## Customize this file for your team

- **Stale signal:** default trusts Unleash's built-in `stale` marker plus a "no SDK has evaluated this flag in N days" rule (default N = 30). Tune N for your team's traffic patterns — low-traffic services may legitimately go longer between evaluations.
- **Age-vs-type thresholds:** defaults follow Unleash's product defaults (release 40d, experiment 40d, operational 7d). If your team customized these in the Unleash admin UI, update the numbers here to match.
- **Permanent-flag exceptions:** Unleash treats `kill-switch` and `permission` as permanent (no expected lifetime). If your team treats other types as permanent, list them here.
- **Cleanup ownership:** default assumes the engineer who created the flag also removes it. If your team has a centralized FeatureOps function, adjust accordingly.

# Cleanup cadence

Most feature flags are temporary by design. Stale flags accumulate technical debt, confuse future readers, and increase the risk that an unrelated change accidentally re-enables old code. This file is loaded when the conversation involves removing flags or auditing for cleanup opportunities.

## When a flag is ready for cleanup

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: adjust the no-activity threshold (lastSeenAt window) for your team's traffic patterns -->

A flag is a cleanup candidate when **any** of these conditions hold (signals listed in order of confidence):

1. **Unleash marked it `stale: true`.** This is the strongest signal — Unleash's own staleness logic decided it's overdue based on type and age.
2. **No SDK has evaluated the flag in 30+ days** in any enabled environment (`environments[].lastSeenAt`). If clients aren't checking it, removing it from code won't change behavior.
3. **Age exceeds the type's expected lifetime** (see the table below). A `release` flag older than 40 days, or an `operational` flag older than 7 days, is overdue by Unleash's defaults.
4. **The feature has fully launched** and the legacy code path is no longer needed (user judgment, not metadata).
5. **The experiment has concluded** and a winning variant has been picked.

### Type-based expected lifetimes

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: replace with your team's customized lifetimes if you changed them in the Unleash admin UI -->

| Type | Default lifetime | Cleanup behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `operational` | 7 days | Audit aggressively — these are meant to be short-term |
| `release` | 40 days | Audit for removal after the rollout stabilizes |
| `experiment` | 40 days | Audit for removal after the experiment concludes |
| `kill-switch` | Permanent | **Skip** — no expected lifetime, meant to live indefinitely |
| `permission` | Permanent | **Skip** — ties to user attributes, not a rollout |

Only `kill-switch` and `permission` are treated as permanent by default. If your team uses operational flags long-term, change the type to `kill-switch` or update the lifetime in the Unleash admin UI.

## Removal workflow

When the user asks to clean up a flag, follow this sequence:

### 1. Get the full picture

Call `cleanup_flag` with the flag name. The tool returns framework-specific guidance based on the language and conventions detected in the codebase. Expect it to include:

- Every file and (where determinable) line number where the flag is referenced — including indirect usages through wrappers.
- The current rollout state across all environments.
- The "enabled" branch — the code path that becomes the default after removal.
- A cleanup checklist tailored to the framework.

Trust the tool's output over your own grep instincts. Real codebases rarely have raw `unleash.isEnabled('flag-name')` calls everywhere; the tool knows how to find the indirect references.

### 2. Confirm the keep path

Before editing anything, confirm with the user which branch should be preserved:

- For a `release` flag at 100%: keep the enabled branch, remove the conditional.
- For an `experiment` flag: keep the winning variant, remove all others and the conditional.
- For a `kill-switch` flag that's being decommissioned: keep the "enabled" path (the new behavior).

Ask the user explicitly if there is any ambiguity. Do not guess.

### 3. Remove the flag's surface area

The shape of "remove the conditional" depends entirely on how the flag is used. Real codebases rarely have raw `unleash.isEnabled('name')` calls scattered through business logic — that's the textbook example, not the common case. Be ready for any of these patterns:

- **Custom wrapper functions:** `featureFlags.isEnabled('name')`, `flags.get('name')`, or project-specific helpers. Removing the flag means removing the call sites *and* potentially the wrapper if this was its only caller.
- **Dependency-injected flag service:** `this.flagService.isEnabled('name')` or constructor-injected `featureFlags`. Check whether the injection can be simplified after removal (e.g., a service that no longer needs the flags dependency).
- **React/Vue hooks and HOCs:** `useFlag('name')`, `useFeatureFlag('name')`, `withFeatureFlag('name')`. Removing the hook usage also means unwrapping the conditional rendering and possibly the HOC.
- **Decorators or annotations:** `@FeatureFlag('name')`, `[FeatureGate("name")]` in some Java/.NET stacks. The decorator itself disappears; whatever it guarded becomes unconditional.
- **Config-driven gating:** flag values mapped into a config object at startup (`config.features.newCheckout`). Remove the config entry, then trace every reader.
- **Server-side rendering / edge:** flag context passed into render functions, middleware, or CDN edge logic. Cleanup may span multiple deployment artifacts.
- **A/B routing:** experiment flags that route traffic to different controllers or templates. Cleanup means deleting the losing branch's code, not just the routing logic.
- **Test fixtures and mocks:** mock providers, fixture flag-state objects, `jest.mock('unleash-client')` setups. These often outlive the production code.
- **Analytics and logging:** flag name as a tag, dimension, or log field. Search for the literal flag-name string, not just the SDK call.

The `cleanup_flag` tool surfaces the language- and framework-appropriate patterns. Use its output as the source of truth. If it misses a pattern that exists in this codebase, surface that gap to the user — don't silently work around it.

After removing all references:

- Promote the "kept" branch to the surrounding scope.
- Delete the fallback/legacy branch entirely.
- Remove now-unused imports, wrappers, hooks, decorators, mocks, and config entries.
- Search the codebase for the literal flag name string (including dashes/underscores variants) to catch references in non-code locations like analytics events.

Do not leave the conditional in place with a TODO. The point of cleanup is to eliminate the branching, not document it.

### 4. Run the relevant tests

Run the test suite for the touched code paths. Pay special attention to:

- Tests that exercised the fallback/losing branch — they should be deleted, not patched to pass.
- Mock providers that listed the removed flag — these need updating.
- Snapshot tests that captured the old conditional rendering — re-snapshot intentionally.

### 5. Delete the flag from Unleash

Only after the code change is merged and deployed to production, delete (or archive) the flag in Unleash. If the flag is deleted while production code still references it, every call to `isEnabled()` returns `false` — silently switching production to the fallback path. Sequence matters.

For `kill-switch` flags, prefer **archive** over delete so the historical incident log is preserved.

### 6. Document the cleanup

If your team tracks technical-debt removal, mention the flag name and merge SHA in the PR description so the rollout history is searchable later.

## Periodic audits

Run a flag audit on a recurring cadence (the `flag-audit.kiro.hook` template in `hooks/` automates this):

1. **List flags** in the target project.
2. **Fetch each flag's state** via `get_flag_state`.
3. **Skip** flags where `type === 'kill-switch'` or `type === 'permission'` — these are permanent by design.
4. **Surface** flags where any of these are true:
   - `stale === true` (Unleash already flagged it)
   - `archived === true` but code references may still exist (check with `cleanup_flag`)
   - All `environments[].lastSeenAt` older than 30 days (no SDK is hitting it)
   - `age(createdAt) > expected_lifetime_for_type(type)` (overdue by Unleash's defaults)
5. **Prioritize** by `stale === true` first, then by oldest `lastSeenAt`, then by `age - expected_lifetime`.

A weekly audit is reasonable for most teams. Run it more frequently during release-heavy periods.

## What not to clean up automatically

Never auto-execute `cleanup_flag` followed by code removal without the user reviewing each step. Flag cleanup touches production code paths and can re-introduce bugs if the wrong branch is preserved. Always present the plan, get confirmation, then act.
